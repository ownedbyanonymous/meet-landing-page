## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Acquired knowledge on the following topics
- Design systems: utilizing design systems to deliver digital products that closely align with established high-fidelity designs and design guidelines.
- Responsive design: developed a better understanding of responsive design principles, enabling the creation of applications that adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.
- CSS Custom Properties: acquired knowledge in leveraging CSS custom properties to enhance code maintainability, reusability, and theming capabilities.


### Continued development

There still knowledge gaps in my understanding of responsive design especially regarding fonts and images
Use of the position CSS property. I still don't understand the difference between absolute and relative and when to use each of the values.
